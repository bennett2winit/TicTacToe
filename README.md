# TicTacToe
This is a game of Tic Tac Toe designed for 2 players. I implemented input checking to make sure that players can't cheat, and added win conditions so that if a player wins the game stops and allows them to play again if they choose.

Both versions of the game were created on my own without a tutorial, a fact which I take great pride in. This is obvious when first looking at the spaghetti code of the version in the deprecated folder. I used the insights I have gained from work to improve the code by using functions, recursion, and some simple algorithms. This took the code from 100+ lines without win conditions to 72 with them included. Please feel free to reach out to me with any suggestions on how to improve!
I am constantly reading new technical books and seeking advice in an attempt to become a faster, better, and more efficient programmer.
